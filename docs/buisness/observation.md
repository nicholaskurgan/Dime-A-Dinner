# Observation from user surveys

## Education
Pretty much all college students, a few international students

This is supported by our user survey

This reinforces our choice to focus on college students

## Kitchen access
The majority of users have access to a kitchen

Supported by the user survey

This reinforces our idea to target users who wish to cook more

## Methods of eating
The most popular method of food was cooking, followed by take-out and college meal plans

User surveys

This shows us what we need to compete with, either in price or nutrition

## Dietary restrictions
Almost all had none but a few had lactose intolerance, halal, peanut-free, vegetarian

User survey

Overall going to target normal diets, if there is time a restriction feature will be added

## User ideas from the survey 
calorie counter
shopping list
health/nutrition score (yuka)

## Team feature ideas
 core function is to find cheap ingredients, other functions will revolve around this
 cheap ingredients will be generalised and not location-specific
 for example, a grocery list can link to what is cheap, recipes can be suggested based on these lists, and users can see nutrition scores for the ingredients
