-Decorated vs simple
-Different setup/information for displaying each item

**A/B Tests**

A/B Test Name: Welcome starting page or straight to login
User Story Number: US1 and US2
Metrics: Happiness and user retention
Hypothesis: Many users probably want to jump straight into the action; immediately being
prompted to login upon opening the app and being taken straight to the features to use
after logging in. However, users might like the app having a home page with a design (logo)
on it upon opening the app, from which they can press a button to login. This could also
provide us somewhere open to give access to things we want user to see, like a way to
take the NPS survey. This could also lead to us getting more NPS answers.
Experiment: Half of users will recieve a welcome screen when they open the app. The other
half will be taken straight to the login page. User retention (users who continue to login
over a span of time) and happiness (most likely from NPS) will be checked between the 2 sample
groups.
Variations: The starting screen would have the logo of the company, some kind of logo text,
and then buttons to take them to login, sing up, and the NPS survey. The non-starting screen
version will being users on a login page with the logo and a button to take them to a separate
sign up page if they need it.
