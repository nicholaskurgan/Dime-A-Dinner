# Observation from user surveys

## education
pretty much all colledge students, a few international students

## kitchen access
majority of users have access to a kitchen

supported by user survey

this reinforces our idea to target users that wish to cook more

## methods of eating
most popular methods of food was cooking, followed by take out and college meal plans

user surveys

this shows us what we need t ocompete with, either in price or nutrition

## dietary restrictions
almost all had none but a few had lactose intolerance, halal, peanut free, vegetarian

user survey

overall going to target normal diets, if there is time a restriction feature will be added

## user ideas from survey 
calorie counter
shopping list
health/nutrition score (yuka)

## team feature ideas
 core function is to find cheap ingredients, other functions will revolve around this
 cheap ingredients will be generalised and not location specific
 for example a grocery list can link to whats cheap, and recipies can be suggested based on these lists, and users can see nutrition scores for the ingredients
